 Utilized a dataset containing 2800 audio samples across seven emotions, including fear, angry, disgust, neutral,
sad, pleasent surprise, and happy, with associated paths and labels.
 Employed librosa to extract MFCC features and Energy of the audio signals.
Developed Machine Learning Models using SVM model,Gradient Boosting and Random Forest Classificationfor
emotion classification using extracted Energy and MFCC features, achieving high accuracy and visualizing results through a
confusion matrix
